# 🔒 Secure Communication Suite

**Secure Communication Suite: A Cryptography Application in Python**

This project is developed as part of the **CSE451: Computer and Network Security** course at **Ain Shams University**. It aims to provide a comprehensive **secure messaging** and **data protection** solution using **cryptographic techniques**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Secure Communication Suite integrates various security mechanisms to protect data **in transit and at rest**. The system incorporates:
- **Block ciphers for symmetric encryption (AES/DES)**
- **Public key cryptosystems for secure key exchange (RSA/ECC)**
- **Hashing for integrity verification (SHA-256/MD5)**
- **Secure key management and authentication**
- **Protection for internet services using cryptographic security**

## 📌 Features & Modules
### 1️⃣ **Block Cipher Module**
- Implements **AES/DES** for symmetric encryption.
- Ensures confidentiality of messages.

### 2️⃣ **Public Key Cryptosystem Module**
- Uses **RSA/ECC** for secure key exchange.
- Enables secure transmission of encryption keys.

### 3️⃣ **Hashing Module**
- Implements **SHA-256/MD5** for message integrity.
- Verifies that received data has not been altered.

### 4️⃣ **Key Management Module**
- Securely generates, distributes, and stores encryption keys.
- Prevents unauthorized access to cryptographic keys.

### 5️⃣ **Authentication Module**
- Implements **password-based or certificate-based authentication**.
- Ensures that only authorized users can access the system.

### 6️⃣ **Internet Services Security Module**
- Applies encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect online communications.
